#### PERIODIZATION:

0. Initial Period (Foundation) (6-12 weeks)
Reps and Sets: 3 sets of 10 reps.
Weight Selection: Choose a weight that allows you to perform 10 reps with good form but that is challenging enough that you can't perform many more than 10. (If you can't do at least 8 reps, you should decrease the weight.)
Progression: Aim to increase the weight by the smallest increment possible once you can perform 3 sets of 10 reps comfortably with good form.


*Once you have completed the Initial Period, you can move on to the following phases…

1. Strength Endurance Phase (6-8 weeks)
Reps and Sets: Increase to 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps.
Weight: Slightly lighter than your 10-rep max to accommodate the increased reps.
Progression: As before, increase the weight when you can perform the top end of the rep range comfortably for all sets.

2. Hypertrophy Phase (6-8 weeks)
Reps and Sets: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
Weight: Choose a weight that is challenging by the last rep of each set.
Progression: Increase weight when you can perform all sets at the top end of the rep range.

3. Maximum Strength Phase (6-8 weeks)
Reps and Sets: 4-5 sets of 4-6 reps.
Weight: Use a weight that is challenging for 4-6 reps, usually a higher percentage of your one-rep max (1RM).
Progression: Increase the weight as you are able to complete the upper range of reps for all sets.

4. Power Phase (OPTIONAL, based on goals, 4-6 weeks)
Reps and Sets: 3-5 sets of 1-3 reps for pure power exercises like Olympic lifts (if applicable).
Weight: This should be close to the maximum you can lift for the low rep range, emphasizing speed and power.
Progression: Progress can be slower in this phase; focus on explosive movement rather than increasing weight.

*After completing Phase 3 (or 4), you can cycle back to any of the previous phases depending on your goals.

#### Deload Weeks:
Every 4-6 weeks, incorporate a deload week where you reduce the weight, volume, or intensity to allow for recovery. This means lifting lighter weights or reducing the number of sets and reps.

#### Adjusting for Personal Needs:
Beginners may need to start with higher rep ranges (12-15) to focus on form and muscular endurance before moving into lower rep ranges.
More advanced lifters may require more complex periodization schemes with varying intensities and volume.

#### General Guidelines:
Always start with a weight that allows you to maintain good form. If form breaks down, the weight is too heavy.
Gradual progression is key. Small increases in weight are more sustainable and less likely to lead to injury.
Log your workouts to track progress.
Rest is important. Ensure you have at least one day of rest between training the same muscle groups.

#### Routine Guidelines:
*When planning your strength training sessions, you have the flexibility to adapt the workout to your time constraints.
- Option 1: Complete Workout
-- If time allows, you can perform all of the exercises listed in the strength training program during each session.
- Option 2: Rotational Selection
-- If you're short on time or prefer shorter sessions, you can choose to do a subset of the exercises from each category. For example, select one exercise from every three (1/3) or every two (1/2) listed and complete those during your session. In subsequent sessions, rotate to the other exercises you didn't perform previously.
**Regardless of the option you choose, always start your strength training sessions with a proper warm-up.**

## Warm-Up Routine:
1. Begin with 5-10 minutes of light cardiovascular exercise such as cycling, jogging, or jumping jacks to increase your heart rate and body temperature.
2. Follow with dynamic stretching to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout ahead. This helps to reduce the risk of injury and improve your performance during the strength exercises.
