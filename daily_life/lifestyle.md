# Basic Formal Sanctuary Lifestyle
This is the Basic Formal Sanctuary Lifestyle intended to be simple and easy for the average person to implement over a short period of time. This plan incorporates intermittent fasting, with an eating window between 11 AM and 7 PM, optimizing digestion and metabolic efficiency. Additionally, it emphasizes daily exercise, including 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity (such as using an exercise bike) immediately upon waking.
