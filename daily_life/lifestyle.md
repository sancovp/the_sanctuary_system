# Basic Formal Sanctuary Lifestyle
This is the Basic Formal Sanctuary Lifestyle, intended to be simple and easy for the average person to implement over a short period of time. This plan incorporates intermittent fasting, with an eating window between 11 AM and 7 PM, optimizing digestion and metabolic efficiency. Additionally, it emphasizes daily exercise, including 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity (such as using an exercise bike) immediately upon waking. A daily stretching routine is also integrated to enhance flexibility and overall well-being. The core benefits of this diet extend beyond nutrition, addressing cardiovascular health, metabolic function, and mobility. Strength training can be added as desired to complement the regimen. By maintaining consistency with meal timing, exercise, and mindful food choices, individuals can achieve a balanced approach to long-term health and fitness.
