while Victory-Promise is about how INTENT is made explicit through manifestation, its power naturally leads to explicitly reifying that manifestation as a system that can induce that recognition of EG and instantiation of the Victory-Promise through it. The success of that process is called Victory-Ability. However, because of how IJEGU is (recursively self-reinforcing), it operates as a valid holon at any stage of development. For example, having VP means you have VA to some degree because VP itself maps back to the imperative of VP in IJEGU. That is an instance of VA... so whenever performing a VP mapping to ascend to VA, one is already VA becoming higher degrees of VA...
