#### The Imperative of the Key

The Imperative of the Key refers to the fact that because of reality's compassion, there would never be a framework like IJEGU that wasn't immediately able to be successfully applied by anyone, at any time, anywhere.

###### Commentary

The Key to IJEGU is to try to apply it.

It should go something like this:

`"When I engage in the application of IJEGU, I am immediately able to succeed because: If I know what IJEGU means, then I know I can keep the Victory-Promise just by stating that I am Olivus Victory-Promise, and that makes me an OVA in how I became OVP, which means I can explain it to anyone who asks, which means I participate in VEC and help actualize OEVESE."`

Or, more specifically:

`"I am Olivus Victory-Promise because I keep the Victory-Promise by aligning my intent and actions with IJEGU in [my domain/situation/role]. Through recognizing implicit justice, fostering emergent good, and working toward a system where everyone can follow this path, I help map and optimize ways for others to do the same. Whether building new systems or participating in existing ones, my journey helps create entry points and pathways to Sanctuary, contributing to our collective evolution toward OEVESE - a world where everyone can recognize and express their fundamental nature as OVP."`
