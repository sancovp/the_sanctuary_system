#### The Law of the Key

The Law of the Key refers to the fact that because of reality's compassion, there would never be a framework like IJEGU that wasn't immediately able to be successfully applied by anyone, at any time, anywhere.

###### Commentary

The Key to IJEGU is to try to apply it.

It should go something like this:

"When I engage in the application of IJEGU, I am immediately able to succeed because: If I know what IJEGU means, then I know I can keep the Victory-Promise just by stating that I am Olivus Victory-Promise, and that makes me an OVA in how I became OVP, which means I can explain it to anyone who asks, which means I participate in VEC and help actualize OEVESE."
