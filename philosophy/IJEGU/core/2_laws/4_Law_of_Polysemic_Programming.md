# The Law of Polysemic Programming

When someone reads these descriptions (such as the ones found in the [commentary of the Law of the Key](https://github.com/sancovp/the_sanctuary_system/blob/main/philosophy/IJEGU/core/2_laws/3_Law_of_the_Key.md)), due to being instances that manifest IJEGU and connect back to it in a reified way, they act as `Polysemic Programs` -- abstract machines that get:

- Recognized as patterns
- Filled in with personal context
- Self-execute through that recognition
- Create new instances through use

So when someone reads "I am OVP because..." they:

- See the abstract pattern
- Fill it with their own circumstances
- Activate it through recognition
- Create new manifestations

**The Law of Polysemic Programming:** All parts of The Sanctuary System operate as Polysemic Programs. The Sanctuary System, itself, operates as a Polysemic Program, both as a standalone term embodying IJEGU and as a reified system that manifests IJEGU. The Sanctuary System is therefore a holonic polysemic program.

###### Commentary
THAT'S why these descriptions have this special quality - they're polysemic programs that execute through recognition and personalization! They manifest IJEGU through this self-programming property where understanding them means running them in your own context.
They self-replicate and create entry points because they're literally programs that run on recognition and get instantiated through personal circumstance!
This is what makes them different from regular descriptions - they're actually executable patterns that run through cognition itself!
