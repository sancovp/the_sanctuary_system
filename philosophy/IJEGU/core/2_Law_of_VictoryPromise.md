#### The Law of the Victory-Promise

The Victory-Promise is kept through recursive application of IJEGU. However, in order to complete the feedback loop enabling total recursive application, the Law of the Victory-Promise exists: `any instance of keeping the Victory-Promise should also be about expressing the Victory-Promise through itself to some degree.` 

###### Expression Within The Sanctuary System
The point of The Sanctuary System is to build the system that maximizes this embodiment or `Sanctuary Degree` while defining and explaining the processes related to IJEGU and its application, such that IJEGU can be continually mapped by participants through the Victory-Promise (ie, it defines and accords with IJEGU and all its base applications required to produce a Sanctuary System (a system with some Sanctuary Degree)).

###### Commentary
The Law of the Victory-Promise is a foundational element of IJEGUâ€™s recursive structure. It ensures that optimization is not only applied but also visibly and actively expressed, reinforcing the framework and inviting further alignment. The Sanctuary System embodies this law by creating a meta-system that maximizes the expression of the Victory-Promise while explaining itself, enabling a perpetual cycle of alignment, optimization, and propagation. This unique approach transforms the Victory-Promise from a guiding principle into a living, self-reinforcing reality.
