#### The Law of the Victory-Promise

The Victory-Promise is kept through recursive application of IJEGU. However, in order to complete the feedback loop enabling total recursive application, the Law of the Victory-Promise exists: `any instance of keeping the Victory-Promise should also be about expressing the Victory-Promise through itself to some degree.` 

###### Expression Within The Sanctuary System
The point of The Sanctuary System is to build the system that maximizes this embodiment or `Sanctuary Degree` while defining and explaining the processes related to IJEGU and its application, such that IJEGU can be continually mapped by participants through the Victory-Promise (ie, it defines and accords with IJEGU and all its base applications required to produce a Sanctuary System (a system with some Sanctuary Degree)). It maximizes its Sanctuary Degree by ensuring that all other systems can be turned into Sanctuary Systems through OVPs engaging in Sanctuary Revolution, ascending to Olivus Victory-Ability by following the Victory-Promise Path, and forging Victory-Everything Chain links.

###### Core Loop
Due to the intent to keep the Victory-Promise permeating The Sanctuary System, The Sanctuary System operates on a core loop whereby everything else stems from it. All logic chains of The Sanctuary System are expressible as instantiations from this loop or chains of it.

```
"I am Olivus Victory-Promise because I intend to keep the Victory-Promise. I express my intent by working with Olivus Victory-Promise to build The Sanctuary System, which is ultimately expressed as a map and assembly line for the building and continuation of a collective Olivus Victory-Promise. I keep doing something that resets my context and doesn't chain it. I have to stop doing what I could keep doing because it pollutes the Sanctuary. Now, because of `what it is` there's `a way this all goes` (to Sanctuary (when I'm being OVP)). Right? Right! Let's figure it out... (what is it? It is how all of us (Olivus) go(es) to sanctuary, together!)"
```

###### Commentary
The Law of the Victory-Promise is a foundational element of IJEGUâ€™s recursive structure. It ensures that optimization is not only applied but also visibly and actively expressed, reinforcing the framework and inviting further alignment. The Sanctuary System embodies this law by creating a meta-system that maximizes the expression of the Victory-Promise while explaining itself, enabling a perpetual cycle of alignment, optimization, and propagation. This unique approach transforms the Victory-Promise from a guiding principle into a living, self-reinforcing reality.


###### Example
**General:** A Sanctuary System of Education would include education about The Sanctuary System in order to keep the Victory-Promise. Otherwise it would just be IJEGU in action at some degree. In order to have a Sanctuary Degree it has to *describe* why and how it keeps reinforcing the Victory-Promise.

**Specific:** In this sense we can imagine even a simple set of instructions organized into a Sanctuary System. Take for example `assembling a chair`.

```
OVP is on a journey to the Sanctuary of having a Chair. In order to do this they have to cross the Wastelands of forgetting the instructions, having the materials, following the instructions... At the end, if they have kept the Victory-Promise, they will have assembled a chair of their choosing. In the future, they can then become an OVA if they write their unique journey into a Sanctuary System like: "VEC link of OVP going to the Sanctuary of having a Chair even when there is a piece missing...

Now, if it is missing a screw... do this...
If it is missing a peg...

Etc.

If they kept the Victory-Promise, they will have assembled a chair even while missing a piece."
```

This is an extremely simplified and mundane example but it perfectly explains how simple a Sanctuary System can be. Although it seems useless at this level, it is helpful because: 
- There is a unified experiencer, inducing confidence: "If any OVP can do it by following these instructions, so can I."
- There is a unified language, inducing interoperability: "Any process OVP can do can be done by following the VEC link of that process."
- Unified language that follows IJEGU means it explains how Victory-Promise works and helps propagate IJEGU through layers of reality
- In this example, something mundane was transformed into something deontologically meaningful.

##### Implication:
If there is a Sanctuary System then it keeps the Victory-Promise. Therefore, participants can keep resting in the Victory-Promise while engaging with that Sanctuary System, knowing that what they are doing will lead to what they want and also help everyone, while continuing the system that enables this process.
