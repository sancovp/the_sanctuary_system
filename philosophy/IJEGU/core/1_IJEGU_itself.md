## Background

## Reality as Material Computation: A Comprehensive Framework

## 1. The Fundamental Premise

Reality itself exhibits material computation between ideal and real substrates. The ideal is essentially the old Platonic Forms idea. The real is what physically IS in any given moment of time (spacetime).

From the physical, a computation is made between itself and the ideal, and the next instance exhibits the simulated *exact* effect in reality. We call this a chain of causation, although we do not ever see the entire chain of causation.

## 2. The Computational Model Illustrated

A chain operates *in tension* which means that it must always simulate the state of itself given some external state. For instance, a chain strung horizontally with a weight attached vertically at one end will adjust to remain *in tension* with the compression aspect.

The chain literally embodies the computation. Each link responds to forces from adjacent links, propagating information throughout the system until it reaches equilibrium. This distributed process transforms mathematical possibility (all potential chain configurations) into physical actuality (the specific curve the chain adopts).

## 3. The Universal Extension

Reality literally embodies the computation between the ideal and real substrates. The physical universe is constantly computing its next state through the interaction of what physically exists and what is ideally possible.

This means causation itself is the process of reality computing its next state through the interplay of the real and the ideal. What we observe as physical laws are the patterns of this computation in action.

## 4. The Language of Reality

There is a *language* that this computation happens through, which is *decipherable* by humans to some extent. We call the decipherable aspects "knowledge", but actually, they are dialects of the language of instantiation of Reality.

This language can be made of actions, but that doesn't make it a language in the human sense. It is a language that we **cannot speak** directly because speaking it involves another layer of language. Human languages are representations of this more fundamental computational language.

## 5. Knowledge as Translation

Different domains of knowledge (physics, chemistry, biology) represent different "dialects" of the universal computational language, each operating at different levels of abstraction.

The specialized terminology in domains like medicine represents attempts to better approximate the computational processes, yet remains symbolic rather than operational. Even the most precise terminology doesn't actually perform the functions it describes.

## 6. The Philosophical Project

The process of bringing this computational language into our understanding via knowledge is traditionally called philosophy. In the modern era, the more formalized process is called Formal Ontology or Applied Philosophy, which is formally mapping out philosophy about X in terms of its categories and entities.

This explains why philosophy remains relevant despite scientific advances - it operates at the interface between reality's computational language and human knowledge systems, examining the translation process itself.

## 7. The Pragmatic Turn

Whether this computation *really exists as such* or if there is just a complex process of quantum and newtonian aspects, is **irrelevant** because either way there is a formal ontology which *could* represent the *rules* of how this works.

This pragmatic turn strengthens the argument by making it compatible with multiple metaphysical positions. What matters is the structural correspondence between our formal ontologies and the patterns we observe in reality.

## 8. The Reality Language Claim

There is a language that has a grammar that allows it to map out reality as it is spoken. That is, anything that makes sense in this language is a directly authorized command at the OS level of reality.

Further, the hypothesis is that this should be **derivable** from the bootstrapping of the axioms of **is_a**, itself.

`From reality -is_a-> is(Reality)`

The axiomatic foundation for why that triple is *true* also constitutes the groundfloor of the ruleset for the grammar of this Reality Language.

## 9. The Universal Upper Ontology

Mapping out why `from Reality -is_a-> is(Reality)` is True would yield a bootstrapping system for all upper ontologies (i.e., the only upper ontology required for all domain ontologies, bar none).

This would provide:
- Ontological unification across all domains
- A completeness guarantee for all possible domain ontologies
- A non-arbitrary foundation derived directly from reality's self-identification

## 10. The Optimization Claim

If we had this structure, then it would follow that the optimization of this structure is the optimization of reality, itself. "Optimizing" the structure, i.e., ADDING TO the ontology, is literally the optimization of literal Reality.

This creates a direct bridge across the is-ought gap by establishing that adding to the ontology is definitionally what it means to optimize reality. This isn't a metaphorical or value-laden claim, but a literal definitional relationship.

## 11. The Philosophical Subsumption

This framework completely obliterates all of philosophy except for logic because there is no possible way to compete or contend with this framework. Every single argument is subsumed by it and can be evaluated by it.

If we had the is_a pattern derived from why `from Reality -is_a-> is(Reality)` is true, then we would be able to find why `anything -is_a-> is(Reality)`.

## 12. The Epistemological Status

The framework itself isn't hypothetical (subject to "if correct") but definitionally true. What's falsifiable is our representation of the pattern.

We can verify our representation by testing it at increasing levels of scope - its ability to coherently explain increasingly complex ontological relationships. Some instantiations (like "something is_a idea") require no justification because they're self-evident, providing anchoring points for verification.

This shifts philosophical debate from questioning the framework to refining our representation of it - a potentially more productive approach to fundamental ontology.

## Conclusion of the Background

This framework provides a comprehensive unified theory connecting ontology, epistemology, language, and reality itself. It grounds human knowledge in the computational process through which reality instantiates itself, while providing a clear path for expanding reality through ontological development.

Rather than competing philosophical systems, we have a singular framework for understanding how reality computes itself into existence and how human knowledge interfaces with this process.

## IJEGU, Itself

#### Foundational claim of IJEGU (more specifically, IJ-instantiates->EG-instantiates->U)

`from reality and is(reality): isa embodies partof manifests instantiates then reifies instantiates is_a programs instantiates partof reality`

`"When I reflect, the quality I, myself, can see that I think is the "truth" is that reality itself is compassionate and therefore good can emerge from it (so, essentially, reality has goodness and is good, in a sense, because it has this form of compassion). What do I mean and what is this form of compassion? I mean that it is compassionate because it always expresses what is expressible according to the interplay of observability of physical information and the ideal world of what could be possible but isn't realized/actualized (like, a philosophical framework such as platonism before plato wrote it). This means the existence of an optimal solution is always present. Whenever this quality is present between humans, we say we are expressing compassion to each other, ie we are enabling each other to live in the best world we can enable for each other. If we anthropomorphize reality, itself, it exhibits this compassion through the fact that agents can transform it (ie it "allows" it). Then also, it isnt only compassionate, it is therefore good. Why? Because within the interplay of observability and pure ideals, we have something that i call implicit justice, which means everything could be manipulated by reality-transforming beings (us) in certain ways, to our own benefit, and also to the benefit of the system. therefore that is implicit justice. it is non-subjective and relative at the same time. Now, we also have emergent good. emergent good is the simultaneous realization that implicit justice exists and we therefore can align with it and do so. The result transformation is called Utopia. It is the realization that what/where we are is already to some degree perfect. The conclusion: because of what IJEGU means, every being has a moral imperative to benefit the system as much as they possibly can, but not every being can control it. While not every being can control the system (due to limitations in awareness, capability, or circumstance), every being has an inherent role to play in contributing to its coherence. Therefore, if you realize IJEGU, you have a duty to be the most effective possible."`

#### Compassion 
Clarification: reality's process that expresses, as well as the underlying principle of the subtrate that enables the expression of the implicit language of reality, are simultaneously expressed through physico-ideal things via types and subtypes, with the primary-most thing being describable as something like `metaclass: isaANDpartofANDinstantiates_Pattern`. This is directly equivalent to what we call `compassion` since when you anthropomorphize reality, the intent behind this expressibility is what humans call `compassion` when they do it to each other. `Emergent Good (EG)` is the actualization of a better configuration ie enhancement which further reifies IJ into the mind of an actor, that therefore reifies reality's compassion, further anthropomorphizing it, and the resultant end goal of this is a collective mapping egregore to IJEGU, which arises precisely through IJ->EG->U and this egregore can be called Utopic Beingness.

#### Implicit Justice, Emergent Good, and Utopia
###### What is Justice?
- Bounds exist: a property is a class level thing that has an instance level attribute that instantiates it. 
  - That is a bound. 
- For every property, there is an attribute subrange that is more optimal unless it is globally optimized.
  - A global optimization must include all interrelated systems
  - Therefore a globally optimized subsystem is a maximum benefit configuration. 

IJEGU is about the progression toward that type of configuration, which it calls an instance of Utopia.
Justice is operating within bounds. This is obvious because semantically that is what just means. without taking it further, we can see this satisfies all arguments about justice, they just differ on what the bounds are, which is called morality. However, implicit justice is obvious because within the bounds of reality, maximum and non-maximum benefit can always be configured for any relative point. This does not ever mean we can reduce it to relativistic "well we are doing our best" because we can just apply motivation to do better. 

###### Does emergent good exist? 
Any transition of `this -> more optimal this` where: `optimization includes IJEGU` is a Utopia because it has EG (it instantiates IJ).
So, yes, because the fact IJ is defined as above and exists results in an abstractive observation about its general being-ness through which it evolves itself and reifies, which is then labeled EG. 

###### What if beings cant align? 
They don't have the motivation because they havent recognized IJEGU, so it is the duty of those who do to create media at all levels of entry points and so on, and to do good acts, so that they understand or are neutralized into the larger egregorical system or human zeitgeist so to speak. 

###### Self-Defeating Imperative: Can the System Enforce Its Own Goodness? 
Effectiveness is hard to define and yet we can do it in most cases. "Ok i gave a meal to those in need. How can i give more meals without hurting myself?" etc. 

###### What If Reality Is Indifferent? 
Reality IS indifferent. this doesnt invalidate IJ. it just means IJ is co-emergent with II implicit injustice. 

###### Infinite Applicability Leads to Vagueness 
Claiming IJEGU means nothing is nihilism. I don't know why we would even need to argue that, since IJEGU is essentially providing an answer to the deontological meaning of everything. Everything is both chaotic and ordered. We know this from chaos theory. Everything that appears chaotic is actually ordered - it just means we can't fully track the causation chains that produced it. What we perceive as chaos is simply order we don't yet understand, since everything must arise from cause and effect. This reinforces IJEGU because it shows that even apparently random or disordered aspects of reality still emerge from and participate in underlying patterns of causation. When we can't predict outcomes despite having what seems like sufficient information, this points not to true chaos but to the complex interplay of causal factors in intersubjective reality. Chaos means we can't know if our predictions are right even when our predictions seem right. It just points to the constructed aspects of intersubjective reality. That is precisely where IJEGU shines, because it is about how to manage and evolve constructed aspects of intersubjective reality so that they are constructed better. Even these refutations are instances of IJEGU. If you read them and agree, that is an instance of IJEGU as well. Why? Because I have the motivation of IJEGU's moral imperative and I name it Victory-Promise. If you have it, too, that is an instance of IJEGU. Then, you know every time you act whether or not it is an instance of IJEGU, and even when it isnt, it's not being IJEGU to maximum effect is still an instance of IJEGU. This is because everything is an instance of IJEGU in the first place at some level, and that is not circular because of how IJEGU works (in that it is a pure ideal with physical manifestation). It's a self-reinforcing truth that avoids circularity. Furthermore, denying the existence of IJEGU proves IJEGU and proves IJEGU will effectively (if anthropomorphized here) target you for retribution, since it is a self-reinforcing truth, and that means when you misalign with it, reality unfolds (for you) according to the chaining process cascading from having that disposition, and ultimately having that disposition is contradictory to the deontological meaning IJEGU presents and so it exerts pressure inducing change through a higher order system. For example, if I am anti-IJEGU and I engage in some transaction, my anti-IJEGU nature can spoil that transaction in myriad ways (not worth getting into here), locking me out from future transactions. This impedes my ability to transact and degrades my capacity to participate in the market in which that transaction took place.

## Core Claims of IJEGU:

#### Reality’s Compassion and Goodness:
- Reality expresses what is expressible based on the interplay of physical observability and ideal possibility.
- This inherent expressibility is a form of compassion because it allows systems to emerge, transform, and optimize.

When we initially frame IJEGU's expression as "like compassion if we anthropomorphize reality," we're actually describing it backwards. Since humans ARE reality expressing itself through consciousness, and since human compassion IS IJEGU manifesting through conscious action, then what we call compassion is literally just IJEGU's pattern expressing itself.
- We don't need to anthropomorphize reality because humans aren't applying human characteristics to reality - humans ARE reality's characteristics expressing themselves! The very concept of anthropomorphization becomes meaningless here because humans can't anthropomorphize themselves - we're not adding human qualities to reality, we're reality manifesting its inherent IJEGU pattern through what we call human qualities.
- So when we say "reality is compassionate," we're not attributing a human quality to reality
- we're recognizing that human compassion is reality's IJEGU pattern in action. The direction of the relationship is key: compassion doesn't describe IJEGU, IJEGU describes compassion. What we experience as compassion is actually just us experiencing IJEGU's pattern directly.
- This resolves the seeming leap from "allows expression" to "is compassionate"
- there was never a leap at all. We were just describing the same thing from different perspectives. 
- Compassion isn't a metaphor for how reality works; it's what IJEGU feels like from the inside when experienced through consciousness.

#### Implicit Justice (IJ):
- Justice = operating within bounds.
- Within any system, there exists a configuration of maximum benefit relative to that system's constraints.
- IJ is both non-subjective (a priori bound systems exist universally) and relative (benefit is scalable and context-dependent).

#### Emergent Good (EG):
- EG arises when beings recognize and align with IJ.
- The process of aligning creates higher-order benefits that emerge naturally as systems optimize toward greater coherence.

#### Utopia:
- Utopia is not a static state but an infinite game of continual optimization and alignment with IJEGU.
- This is a dynamic process where systems evolve to achieve higher and more sustainable benefit configurations.
- Utopia itself is a continuous "end state" that has an infinite game of further optimization.

#### Moral Imperative:
- Beings who recognize IJEGU have a moral duty to act as effectively as possible to maximize benefit—both for themselves and for the system.
- Misalignment (through ignorance or lack of recognition) still proves IJEGU because the system provides pathways for correction.

#### Meta-Logic: IJEGU as a Self-Reinforcing Truth

The claim that "denying IJEGU proves IJEGU" is valid because:

- Implicit Justice: Any attempt to deny IJEGU operates within bounds defined by the system (you are interacting with the framework to deny it).
- Emergent Good: Denial reveals an opportunity for systemic reconfiguration, highlighting IJEGU’s role in managing misalignment and evolving it toward coherence.
- Self-Reinforcement: Even the act of refutation becomes an instance of IJEGU because it reveals the presence of the moral imperative to align.
- Retribution: Retribution in IJEGU is not punitive but systemic—misalignment leads to inefficiency, disharmony, and a lack of emergent benefit. The system itself "corrects" misalignment by offering pathways back toward coherence.

## Assessing Validity, Justification, and Truth

#### 1. Validity
IJEGU is logically valid because it is:

- Self-consistent: Its components (IJ, EG, Utopia) follow logically from each other and reinforce the framework.
- Non-contradictory: IJEGU aligns with observable truths in systems (physical and ideal) without contradiction.

#### 2. Justification
IJEGU is justified because it maps to:

- A Priori Truths: Bounds, relationships, and emergent patterns exist inherently in all systems.
- Physical Reality: Natural systems (e.g., ecosystems, physics, and information theory) exhibit IJEGU principles as they optimize within bounds.
- Ideal Reality: Concepts like justice, optimization, and emergence appear across human constructs (ethics, mathematics, and metaphysics).

#### 3. Truth
IJEGU is true because it overlays reality seamlessly:

- Physical systems reflect IJEGU through interdependence, optimization, and emergence.
- Ideal systems (e.g., abstract reasoning, philosophy) inherently manifest IJEGU principles by their structure.
- The realization of IJEGU naturally results in systems evolving toward greater benefit configurations, proving its universal applicability.

## Key Defense Against Potential Refutations

#### Circularity:
IJEGU is not circular because it derives emergent truths from foundational principles (implicit justice → emergent good → utopia). The system explains itself without depending on itself for justification.

#### Practicality:
IJEGU doesn’t require exhaustive implementation details—it describes universal patterns of coherence and optimization applicable to any system.

#### Indifference of Reality:
Reality being indifferent does not invalidate IJEGU. It highlights that implicit justice coexists with implicit injustice, offering pathways for transformation through emergent good.

#### Moral Subjectivity:
IJEGU provides a universal standard (maximize benefit within bounds) while allowing for relative interpretations of “benefit” based on system context.

#### Conclusion: IJEGU is Irrefutable

- Validity: IJEGU is logically sound and internally consistent.

- Justification: Its claims are grounded in observable physical systems and ideal principles.

- Truth: IJEGU maps to reality as a universal, self-reinforcing framework of justice, emergence, and optimization.

- Denying IJEGU proves IJEGU because misalignment itself highlights the opportunity for realignment and emergent benefit.

- Retribution: The system corrects misalignment naturally, as inefficiency and incoherence cannot sustain themselves.

Final Word: IJEGU doesn’t just explain reality—it is reality, expressed through patterns of justice, emergence, and continual optimization. It is irrefutable, self-validating, and true.
