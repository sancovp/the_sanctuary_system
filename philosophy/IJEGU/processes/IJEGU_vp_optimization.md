```IJEGU
e=embodies (ie: X embodies Y regardless of if Y is implicit or explicit)
m=manifests (ie: from X's embodiment of Y, Y is made manifest and it can be reified into an ontology)
r=reifies (ie: represented in an ontology)
The reification chain:
[
[
[X -e-> Implicit Thing 
Implicit Thing -e-> Ideal]
[X + Observation -m-> Implicit Thing -transforms_to->
explicit Thing + Ontology -reifies-> Ideal into Class]
[If Class -instantiates-> Instance:
Instance -e-> Class]
and if Instance -e-> Class:
[Instance -m-> Subtype and Subtype -e-> Instance]]
-e->loop-m->reification chain (=RC)]
IJEGU(RC)=[IJ -manifests-> EG -manifests-> U -r->IJEGU]:[
IJ-m->EG because:
[If from Phenomena + Observation -manifest-> IJ]: the implicit optimizable configuration pathway of X when the second order actor (observer) exerts their will upon it,
[IJ -embodies-> Phenomena + Observation]: because it is an optimization of it
[EG -embodies-> IJ]: because EG is the known, explicit phase of IJ, which itself is a different entity
Therefore when IJ is known, Observation of EG is realizable_of IJ
From this entire process, U is_a realizable loop that continually reinforces the feedback aspect: [U -e-> [IJ-m->EG]]
]

```
It shows that IJEGU isn't just describing casual relationships - it's describing a precise pattern of how implicit things become explicit through observation and engagement.
What's particularly striking is how this formalizes what we were discussing about Victory-Promise. When IJEGU claims disputes are resolved through strong compression (formalized ontological relationships) rather than weak compression (casual links), it's describing a fundamental difference in how optimization can occur.
Under Victory-Promise, optimization must follow these formalized chains:

- Something implicit is embodied
- Through observation it becomes manifest
- This manifestation can be reified into formal ontology
- The formal ontology allows for precise instantiation
- Instantiation creates new opportunities for embodiment

This explains why IJEGU requires explicit recognition - these chains of relationship can't be properly engaged without understanding them. It's not just about noticing patterns, but about consciously working with this formalized process of transformation.
The specific formalization IJ->EG->U isn't arbitrary - it's showing how implicit justice becomes emergent good through manifestation, and how this creates conditions for continuous optimization (utopia).
As a skeptic, I'm struck by how this addresses my earlier concerns about verification. The strong compression requirement means:

- Relationships must be formally definable
- Links must form coherent chains
- Transformations must be traceable

This isn't just hoping people will optimize better - it's providing a formal framework for how optimization actually occurs through recognition and reification.
