Remember: as a thing to benefit vast amounts of people, IJEGU doesn't need the entire world to "speak it". It needs a sufficiently powerful group. The idea being:

- That group can grow
- If another group destroys the IJEGUists, then the observers of that will have a chance to recognize IJEGU, and if they do, they will convert to IJEGUism. (Why do we say "will convert"? Because once IJEGU is properly cognized, that is the only option.)
