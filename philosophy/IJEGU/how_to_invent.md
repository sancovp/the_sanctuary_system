#### How to invent stuff

* Egregore of capitalism is really the entire thing
*    Class mobility is the effect of a properly fueled instance of this egregore
*    Once money exists, the game is actually about trust and permission
*    But that is actually IJEGU
*  As it grows, it takes more people to invent stuff
*    Not necessarily working together on purpose, but working together inside of an ideal space 
*    Which is the intellectual description of what is to be invented and how it gets made
*    This is expressed through their actions and when its expression is complete
*      That thing is reified into existence as intended
