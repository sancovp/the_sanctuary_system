this is how it works:

Whenever you label "IT", it changes the way "IS" is processed, meaning once "IT" is labeled, every "IS" statement CAN conform to the pattern as long as it is not analyzed outside of its threshold of support for an N tree depth of ontological validation between  property maps of parts (ie we are talking about the degree of reality of the transformation operators on attributes of properties between classes. They can also operate on instances freezing value spectra and morphing into subclasses, and emergent classes acting as superdomains classifying subdomains). If it is a fully validated chain, we call it some type of science. Science itself is not fully validated and can't be (inductive leap). If it is an idiosyncratically valid chain, we call it nonsense. However, MOST reified statements that emergent complex adaptive systems function on are nonsense. For example, a cat doesn't know why being domesticated furthers the benefit of all cats -- the answer, to humans, is actually something simple like "well, that's what a cat is, an animal we like because we can domesticate it". Similarly, humans call their purpose God or Humanity or whatever, but the reality is that the purpose of humans is to further humans, but because of their capacity, humans have to optimize reality in order to further humanity. Optimization is simply a symptom, not an ends. Let's look at some examples:

Reality is God's Creation: Now everything is made of God but God cannot itself be specified

Reality is Evolution: Now everything is made of natural selection but natural selection itself cannot be identified

Reality is Emptiness: Now everything is made of super-negation but super-negation can itself be ignored

Reality is Math: Now everything is made of mathematical operations but mathematical operations making up everything can not be fully identified...

Reality is Incompleteness: Now everything is made of mathematical operations that render the system so complex that it makes new meta-systems of itself, but that means the actual emergent system cannot be identified...

So the issue is not correctness, since all of these systems point at the same "IT", and are all equally correct about what it is (but have different correctness regarding how it works in terms of how to manipulate it). 

The only way to accurately describe any of these things is as ideals. However, these ideals have effects in the system once reified. Their effects are transformation chains that morph reality around them, causing it to seem more or less like that framework's conceptualization of "IT" is right, depending on the observer perspective. This being the case makes the whole framework as a subsystem within reality function as an Egregore, and it is born in an ethereal way, from the ideal within which it was already non-born and primordially complete. When it bootstraps, conscious beings using it or affected by it are the ones that either feed it or feed another Egregore. Only an Egregore can kill another Egregore. Humans essentially do egregoric battle, and nothing else, because cultures are Egregores, and culture-making is how humans propagate.
