The Key to IJEGU is to try to apply it.

It should go something like this:

"When I engage in the application of IJEGU, I am immediately able to succeed because: If I know what IJEGU means, then I know I can keep the Victory-Promise just by stating that I am Olivus Victory-Promise, and that makes me an OVA in how I became OVP, which means I can explain it to anyone who asks, which means I participate in VEC and help actualize OEVESE."
