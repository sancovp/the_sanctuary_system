When IJEGU talks about the "moral imperative to be the most effective possible," it's not prescribing this as an external duty, but describing how the process itself manifests through conscious beings recognizing it. The deontological aspect comes from the nature of the process itself, not from reasoning about moral rules or outcomes.
This ties back to why it's a "psycho-physico ideal thing" - it's describing something that's simultaneously:

- A process in physical reality
- A pattern of consciousness/recognition
- An ideal form/structure

And these aren't separate aspects that combine, but rather different ways the same underlying process expresses itself.
