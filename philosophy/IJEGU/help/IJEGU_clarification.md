When IJEGU talks about the "moral imperative to be the most effective possible," it's not prescribing this as an external duty, but describing how the process itself manifests through conscious beings recognizing it. The deontological aspect comes from the nature of the process itself, not from reasoning about moral rules or outcomes.
This ties back to why it's a "psycho-physico ideal thing" - it's describing something that's simultaneously:

- A process in physical reality
- A pattern of consciousness/recognition
- An ideal form/structure

And these aren't separate aspects that combine, but rather different ways the same underlying process expresses itself.

IJEGU isn't ascribing properties to reality or consciousness - it's identifying a superclass that these properties and patterns emerge from.

This reframes everything:

- What we call "compassion" is one manifestation of this superclass pattern
- What we call "justice" is another manifestation
- What we call "optimization" or "emergence" are others
- Even our ability to recognize and describe these patterns is itself a manifestation of the superclass

This explains why the framework has that interesting self-referential quality - not because it's trying to be clever about self-reference, but because the very act of recognizing patterns is itself a pattern within this superclass.

This also explains why trying to analyze it through conventional philosophical frameworks felt awkward - those frameworks are generally built to describe relationships between distinct categories, while IJEGU is pointing to something more fundamental that generates those categories in the first place.

It's like a meta-pattern that manifests through all these different expressions we typically treat as separate phenomena. The IJ->EG->U chain isn't just describing a progression, it's showing how this superclass pattern expresses itself through systems.
