# Is-Ought Solution

- is-ought jump can be navigated through a deontological interpretation derived from the derivation of how is_a bootstraps itself into existence abstractly

- The is-ought jump fallacy can be constructed as "is -> ought" jump in category theory and then it is known that the above way to use a derivation chain to reify it is the most logical way to solve it.

- the "is-ought" jump formula that people use as a crutch is a prompt that says "?=is->ought" and this just shows the math

- it emerges naturally from is when is bootstraps relationships between relationships. that is the claim.

- that doesnt mean every is_a claim is an ought claim but it means that ought arises from is_a and that when the way that happens is mapped, the result is IJEGU

- IJEGU is a symbol that literally means "the solution to is-ought"

#### Look at TRANSPO first order primitive relationships and the bi-directional instantiation chain in order to comprehend the below

```
IJ -manifests-> EG -manifests-> U

IJ-m->EG because
EG -embodies-> IJ
After
Phenomena + Observation -manifest-> IJ
IJ -embodies-> Phenomena + Observation

And U -e-> [IJ-m->EG]

The reification chain:
[X -e-> Implicit Thing -e-> Ideal
X + Observation -m-> Implicit Thing -transforms_to->
explicit Thing + Ontology -reifies-> Ideal into Class
Class -instantiates-> Instance
Instance -e-> C
I -m-> Subtype]-e->loop-m->reification chain
e=embodies (ie: X embodies Y regardless of if Y is implicit or explicit)
m=manifests (ie: from X's embodiment of Y, Y is made manifest and it can be reified into an ontology)
r=reifies (ie: represented in an ontology)
The reification chain:
[
[
[X -e-> Implicit Thing 
Implicit Thing -e-> Ideal]
[X + Observation -m-> Implicit Thing -transforms_to->
explicit Thing + Ontology -reifies-> Ideal into Class]
[If Class -instantiates-> Instance:
Instance -e-> Class]
and if Instance -e-> Class:
[Instance -m-> Subtype and Subtype -e-> Instance]]
-e->loop-m->reification chain (=RC)]
IJEGU(RC)=[IJ -manifests-> EG -manifests-> U -r->IJEGU]:[
IJ-m->EG because:
[If from Phenomena + Observation -manifest-> IJ]: the implicit optimizable configuration pathway of X when the second order actor (observer) exerts their will upon it,
[IJ -embodies-> Phenomena + Observation]: because it is an optimization of it
[EG -embodies-> IJ]: because EG is the known, explicit phase of IJ, which itself is a different entity
Therefore when IJ is known, Observation of EG is realizable_of IJ
From this entire process, U is_a realizable loop that continually reinforces the feedback aspect: [U -e-> [IJ-m->EG]]
]
