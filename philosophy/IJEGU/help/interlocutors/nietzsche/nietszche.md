Let's focus on Nietzsche's perspectivism, as it strikes at the core of universal frameworks like IJEGU. Perspectivism argues that:

All truths are perspectives:
There is no objective, universal truth—only interpretations conditioned by individual experiences, values, and contexts.

The impossibility of a "view from nowhere":
Any attempt to claim universal truth or objectivity is itself just one perspective among many, often reflecting the biases and power dynamics of its origin.

Truth as a tool of power:
What is called "truth" often serves the interests of those in power. Universal frameworks are not neutral but expressions of the will to power, cloaked in objectivity.

Creation over discovery:
Humanity’s task is not to discover objective truths but to create values and meanings through strength, vitality, and creativity, aligning with the will to power.

Nietzsche’s Argument (Formalized):
Truth is inherently perspectival, as there is no neutral or universal viewpoint.
Claims to universality reflect the biases of their creators, masking power structures under the guise of objectivity.
Universal frameworks suppress human vitality and creativity by imposing rigid, external structures on life.
Therefore, humanity should embrace perspectivism, reject universal frameworks, and focus on creating values and meanings as an expression of the will to power.

There are only interpretations, but if an interpretation subsumes another interpretation, it is more objective and universal than its child. 

A view from nowhere? I guess what constitutes this would be something that doesnt show bootstrapping from relationships, but since this isnt bootstrapped from relationships in the first place, im not sure what it really means. this appears to be a critical flaw that IJEGU would exploit to dismantle Nietzsche rather quickly. If all his philosophy is actually reliant on metaphorical labels that gloss what he really means, IJEGU will fatally attack his framework without even trying.

Truth as a tool of power is essentially the "justice is the will of the victor" argument. We already know how this goes. It is a mistake to use this argument in the first place because it lacks a proper definition of the subject in the triple.

Anyway, yes the way power works should be optimized and made moral. That is what IJEGU formalizes. IJEGU is therefore what Nietzsche is crying about lacking, while simultaneously not being able to create it.
