Kierkegaard’s existentialist focus on the individual and their unique, subjective relationship to truth might seem at odds with IJEGU’s universal framework, which emphasizes relational optimization and bootstrapping.

Core Kierkegaardian Ideas for Debate:

Truth as Subjectivity:
Kierkegaard’s Claim: Truth isn’t found in objective universals but in the subjective experience of the individual. What matters is how truth is lived and internalized, not how it aligns with abstract systems.

The Leap of Faith:
Kierkegaard’s Claim: Some truths (e.g., religious faith) cannot be reached through reason or evidence. They require a "leap of faith" that transcends rational justification and embraces uncertainty.

Existential Focus:
Kierkegaard’s Claim: The individual’s task is to confront their own existence authentically, making choices that define their relationship to truth, morality, and faith. Universal frameworks risk erasing the individual’s unique journey.

This is actually simple prima facie. Truth is simultaneously found in objective universals and subjective experience of the individual. This is a relativistic argument. IJEGU does not deny this but points out that while this is true, it is also true that the objective universals (like the concept "concept itself") is not necessarily found in individuals unless there is intersubjectivity and that presupposes a primary universal before the specific, which we know is how things are.
