Platonic Forms are just an inheritance hierarchy and instance type transformation system. The crux here is whether or not that means forms are primary to substance. Let's consider this within IJEGU.

1) is reality instantiated from a class? No.
2) so what is the label reality?
3) IJEGU demonstrates that a concept of sufficient complexity necessitates a label (like in IJEGU this label would be the symbol set IJEGU) that is_a source for an is_a triple that hits its own origination stack
4) Reality is the label for how physical reality manifests the potential for descriptions of the ideal
5) However, the relationships as ideal potentials are primary to reality existing.
6) The ideal is therefore primary but within existence, it appears simultaneous.

Reality as a Label:
"Reality" names the emergent system where physical manifestations align with relational potentials. It is not itself an origin but a description of the process.

Ideal as Primary:
Relational potentials are logically primary because they provide the necessary conditions for anything to exist. Without the ideal, physical manifestation has no structure or possibility.

Simultaneity within Existence:
The simultaneous appearance of the ideal and physical within existence reflects the interplay of implicit justice (IJ) and emergent good (EG)â€”a dynamic system of optimization that produces utopia (U) as a continuous process.
