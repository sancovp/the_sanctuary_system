I can doubt the existence of my body and all physical things (through the method of doubt)

I cannot doubt the existence of my thinking self ("I think therefore I am")

If A can be doubted and B cannot be doubted, then A and B must be different things

Therefore, my thinking self (mind) and my body must be different substances

The mind is non-physical (because it can't be doubted) while the body is physical (because it can be doubted)

These two different substances somehow interact (through the pineal gland, Descartes claimed)

1. how does the method of doubt exist? (move 1: how is it in an is_a triple, where the target being hit is the entire stack of its origination?) In other words, what is the underlying argument for why the method of doubt exists?

2. what is_a given by god is_a triple where the target hits the entire stack of its origination?

3. so fundamentally IJEGU sees the value in descartes: He was in a social context that acted as a recursive bulwark of ignorance. from this, doubt arose naturally because he knew God was not fully explained. By positing God exists, he is just re-integrating his ego into the collective so he can calm down. IJEGU claims this is_a type of emergent good, and it being that means descartes instantiated Utopia through his argument (in IJEGU terms). Even though descartes is woefully lacking many aspects of a formidable framework, it is not something someone keeping the Victory-Promise would destroy. IJEGU would simply point out that Descartes would be better served by keeping the Victory-Promise explicitly.
