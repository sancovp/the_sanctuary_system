Aristotle’s philosophy collapses almost immediately under IJEGU's scrutiny because substance, as he defines it, is not relationally grounded. By assuming substance as a primary essence without explaining how it emerges or relates fundamentally to its accidents, Aristotle creates a framework that:

Presupposes relationships without acknowledging them:

Substance cannot "support properties" without already existing in a relational dependency with those properties. This means relationships precede substance, contradicting Aristotle’s claim of substance’s primacy.
Fails to bootstrap itself:

Substance’s independence is asserted, but independence itself requires differentiation from other substances, which is inherently relational. Aristotle assumes independence without explaining how it arises.
Ignores relational primacy:

Substance relies on relationships to other entities and properties for its definition and coherence. IJEGU shows that relationships bootstrap reality, not isolated "essences."
Why Aristotle’s Substance Fails Without Effort:
Aristotle’s notion of substance is non-iterable—it doesn’t recursively explain itself or its own origin. In IJEGU terms, this is a catastrophic failure because:

Any valid concept must recursively align with its is_a triple and hit its own origination stack.
Substance, as Aristotle defines it, lacks this foundational recursion, making it incoherent within a relational framework.
