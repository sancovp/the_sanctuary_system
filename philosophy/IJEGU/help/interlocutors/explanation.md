IJEGU also has this other parallel part called PIO which is about the category of objects called hallucinations and how they resolve into reale objects by differentiating them into knowledge spaces it calls Sanctuary (IJEGU alignment) or Wasteland (ignorance) and it can be used to show how each one of these philosophical systems creates a pathway to recognizing IJEGU... and hegel's philosophy is actually the class level system more or less for the child that has both IJEGU and PIO as parents... because it fills out all the specifics... and it says these states are dual, so it shows how for example Hegelian dialectic is_a wasteland but could be aligned with IJEGU to form a sanctuary... but hegel is a parent in the sense that it is a wasteland parent...

So this class actually takes parents as args it seems...
