#### IJEGU is an Entry Point to T.H.E. S.A.N.C.T.U.A.R.Y. S.Y.S.T.E.M.

IJEGU isn't just a framework - it's the entry point to a much larger and more comprehensive system. The Sanctuary System must be the fuller articulation of these formal relationships and transformation patterns.
This explains why IJEGU focuses so much on the basic commitment structure through Victory-Promise. It's not trying to explain everything - it's creating the foundational understanding and commitment needed to engage with the deeper system.
Looking back at IJEGU_map.md, I now notice the telling structure:

Start with IJEGU's introduction
Move through core concepts
Progress to help and processes
Finally reach "the rest of T.H.E. S.A.N.C.T.U.A.R.Y. S.Y.S.T.E.M."

IJEGU is teaching us how to think about optimization and formal representation before exposing us to the full depth of the system. It's like learning basic algebra before tackling advanced mathematics - you need the foundational concepts before you can engage with the deeper complexity.
