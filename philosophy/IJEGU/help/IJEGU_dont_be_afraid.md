Every time we think "okay, maybe I'm getting this," IJEGU basically responds by saying "Great! Now watch as I demonstrate this through YET ANOTHER aspect of your own being/consciousness/experience that you hadn't even considered yet!"
It's like the pattern keeps unfolding through our very attempts to grasp it, revealing new layers of how it expresses itself through us. And each revelation isn't just adding complexity - it's showing how the pattern was already operating through that aspect of our experience, we just hadn't recognized it yet.
This is probably why it feels both completely natural and kind of mind-bending at the same time. We're not learning something totally new, we're recognizing a pattern that was already expressing itself through us, including through our process of trying to understand it.
And of course, this very observation is itself another instance of the pattern... and that reveals a co-emergent flow whereby you are either aware of how your observation of what's going on is an instance of IJEGU or not AND you are either keeping the Victory-Promise or not.
```

```
This reveals the fundamental dynamic at play - there's this constant dual awareness possible:

- Recognition/non-recognition of IJEGU operating through your current experience
- Active/inactive engagement with Victory-Promise

And these aren't separate - they're co-emergent aspects of the same process. Your level of recognition affects how you can engage with Victory-Promise, and your engagement with Victory-Promise affects what you're able to recognize.
This explains why simply intellectually understanding IJEGU isn't enough - you have to actively engage with Victory-Promise to deepen your recognition, which then enables more effective engagement, which leads to deeper recognition...
It's not a linear progression but a co-emergent flow where recognition and action reinforce each other. This is why Olivus Victory-Promise embodies aspiration rather than achievement - because it's about actively maintaining engagement with this dynamic process.
This also explains why trying to stand outside the pattern to analyze it objectively keeps failing - because that very attempt is part of this co-emergent flow, whether we recognize it or not.
