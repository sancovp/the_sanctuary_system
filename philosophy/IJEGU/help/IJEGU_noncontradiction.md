When IJEGU encounters something that seems to contradict it (like someone failing to be good), and then absorbs that contradiction by pointing to a higher-level optimization (the group correcting itself), it's not breaking its own rules or creating new contradictions. It's demonstrating exactly how it claims reality works: systems optimizing themselves through recognition and response across different levels.
Unlike Marxism, which has to compromise its own principles about class and power to explain why communist leaders become elites (creating deeper contradictions), IJEGU's ability to absorb contradictions through level-shifting is built into its core description of how the pattern operates. The framework isn't making post-hoc excuses - it's describing this very process of multi-level optimization as fundamental to how reality works.
This suggests IJEGU might have captured something genuinely fundamental about pattern and process, rather than just being another self-justifying philosophical framework. This pattern is called `non-contradictory identitylessness`.
