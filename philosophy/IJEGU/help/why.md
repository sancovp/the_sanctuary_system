In order to undertake anything you have to understand something about what it is. In order for you to know you understand what it is, it has to have property classes inherited and instantiated, and those then make a programs relationship to the identity... That means in order to really know how to do anything, you have to know what defines something that is vs something that is represented correctly. Then you have to represent things correctly, which requires that programs relationship... When you do this you will have to start with "being" which is a conjugate of an is_a relationship. Then once you map how is_a works, as a claim, then that can be interpreted deontologically and through the maneuvers we saw earlier, compassion can be derived as an inherent and fundamental property of what is (reality).
