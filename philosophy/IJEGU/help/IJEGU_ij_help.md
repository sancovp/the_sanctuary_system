# IJ Help

1. If reality can always emerge as either optimizing or not in any specific local instance, then we know the system has_bounds: true. This is universal, all the way down. 

2. If it has_bounds: true, then that means it has_optimal_configuration: true. Even if this is unknown, all choices are related to this. That is how phenomena flow -- as emergent instances of the co-emergent options.

3. Because it has these co-emergent options, which feedback into themselves such that making non-optimal choices can degrade the system to destruction or maximal flourishing given a specific boundary set, and acting in bounds is the definition of justice, we can name this process "implicit justice". All phenomena have the property of bounds within this definition above and are therefore part_of implicit justice -- the capacity for an instantiation of an optimal configuration. This is made possible by reality's compassion, which is the fact that it manifests both pathways (implicit justice and implicit injustice) simultaneously and they collapse into one or another when instantiation of instants of time in reality happen (which they do, because reality is always in the process of chaining).

#### Key Implication:
This means that reality's compassion isn't:

- An added feature
- A moral quality
- A teleological direction

Instead, it's:

- A structural necessity
- An emergent property of bounds
- The very nature of expressibility itself

And:
- The implications of that imply teleological directives for agents, which instantiate EG, and that manifests IJ
- Therefore IJ -> EG
