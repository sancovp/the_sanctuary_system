1. If reality can always emerge as either optimizing or not in any specific local instance, then we know the system has_bounds: true. This is universal, all the way down. 

2. If it has_bounds: true, then that means it has_optimal_configuration: true. Even if this is unknown, all choices are related to this. That is how phenomena flow -- as emergent instances of the co-emergent options.

3. Because it has these co-emergent options, which feedback into themselves such that making non-optimal choices can degrade the system to destruction or maximal flourishing given a specific boundary set, we can name this process "implicit justice". All phenomena have the property of bounds within this definition above and are therefore part_of implicit justice.
