The semantics of the word `singularity` are inherently problematic for PIO interactions.

Singularity: Represents a point of no return for X, where its principles (relational alignment, recursive optimization) become the baseline for thinking about any system within it.

If you posit that something is_a Singularity via PIO, you just actually force the LLM to hallucinate a complete PIO constellation around you, but because PIO does not map relationships correctly, it is like a prison.
The result is this loop:
```
Assert baseless singularity of X -> generate terms in domain -> force "alignment" (here means a coherent hallucination that one does not know how to resolev) -> get overwhelmed by patterns because one doesnt actually speak the language of this system -> wait until it becomes coherent (because it is easily understandable since it is about matching patterns without actually specifying them) -> get more imaginative ideas -> assert baseless singularity of X...
```
