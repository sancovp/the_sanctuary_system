# The TRANSPO Structure
TRANSPO consists of multiple sub-ontologies. 
- YOUKNOW: This is the ontology of ontologies. It describes the structure of ontology types required to make a unified and operationalizable representation of a concept.
- UCO: This is the Universal Chain Ontology. It describes the structure of a chain and how chains are required to make primitive concepts like properties and relationships.
- PIO: This is the Polysemic Imaginary Ontology. It describes the workflow for understanding and operationalizing knowledge, especially through the use of generative systems.
- SOPHIA: This is the core concept that classifies and typifies the object "IJEGU" and operationalizes it as a SOPHIA Agent within the system that can run TRANSPO with an orchestrator agent.
