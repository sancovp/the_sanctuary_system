The `vehicularizes` relationship essentially is the flag that denotes whether or not a class that doesnt exist yet (is implicit) can be reified in such a way that an instance of it will exist, and the subtypes will be mineable.

###### Note
Without semantic generative capacities, `vehicularizes` is an impossible relationship that almost always yields garbage. A reasoner could cluster properties that should be vehicularized but cant meaningfully label the resultant node. The failure of labeling makes it only machine readable. Ontology is about human readability and machine interoperability, so this is a failure that is catastrophic to the purpose at hand. It would therefore be excluded from traditional ontologies even though it is possible. Making it operational inside of TRANSPO requires SOPHIA, and that's why SOPHIA is a part_of TRANSPO, even if SOPHIA can be rendered as just the agent making the semantic observation (and could be a human).
