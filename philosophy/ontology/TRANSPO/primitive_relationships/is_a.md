# Definition of `is_a`
X is_a Y if:
- a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes
- and therefore X *manifests* Y.

When the above manifestation is reified, the resultant claim is formatted as: `X is_a Y` and implicitly means `"a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes"`.
