# Definition of `is_a`
X is_a Y when a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes, and therefore X *manifests* Y. When that manifestation is reified, the resultant claim is formatted as: X is_a Y and implicitly means "a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes".
