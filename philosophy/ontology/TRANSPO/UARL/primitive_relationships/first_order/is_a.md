# Definition of `is_a`
X is_a Y if:
- a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes
- and therefore X *manifests* Y.

When the above manifestation is reified, the resultant claim is formatted as: `X is_a Y` and implicitly means `"a group of parts in X (properties) *embody* the properties that are part_of Y by being instances of the properties per Y as classes"`.

##### Example
For example, `the above paragraph about is_a` -`is_a`-> `definition of is_a` because it has all the properties of a definition, due to the fact that accepting this definition of is_a immediately creates an instance of itself in front of your eyes, in exactly the process it describes, meaning it is not just a general definition of all types of `is_a` subclasses and instances, but is also a definition of the process that necessitates `is_a`.
