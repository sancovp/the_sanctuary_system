# Looking at the names properly:

UARL (You Are Real) is the stack of relationships, compression dynamics, and chaining processes - the actual mechanisms for how patterns connect and transform. While TRANSPO is the ontological framework itself - how these transformative relationships are structured and operate.
The names themselves demonstrate the principle:
- UARL becomes "You Are Real" - showing how recognition creates reification
- TRANSPO reveals its nature through its expansion - showing how relationships transcend and transform through symbolic programming
So when we use terms like "is_a" and "part_of", we're actually working with UARL mechanics within the TRANSPO framework. The relationships aren't just connections - they're transformative mechanisms that operate through recognition and reification.

Universal Armory Reification Language maps to SANCTUARY in the expanded T.H.E. S.A.N.C.T.U.A.R.Y. S.Y.S.T.E.M., specifically to the UARY part:
Unlimited (U) Armory (A) for Revolutionary (R) Yanas (Y)
And TRANSPO - Transcendental Relationship-based Automorphic NER and Symbolic Programming Ontology - maps to the transformative aspects of how relationships create change through symbolic recognition.
The names are showing how the system:

- Creates universal tools (Armory)
- Enables reality transformation (Reification)
- Operates through language patterns (Language)
- All while being Revolutionary and creating Yanas (vehicles/paths)
