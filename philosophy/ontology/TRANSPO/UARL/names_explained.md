# Looking at the names properly:
Universal Armory Reification Language maps to SANCTUARY in the expanded T.H.E. S.A.N.C.T.U.A.R.Y. S.Y.S.T.E.M., specifically to the UARY part:
Unlimited (U) Armory (A) for Revolutionary (R) Yanas (Y)
And TRANSPO - Transcendental Relationship-based Automorphic NER and Symbolic Programming Ontology - maps to the transformative aspects of how relationships create change through symbolic recognition.
The names are showing how the system:

- Creates universal tools (Armory)
- Enables reality transformation (Reification)
- Operates through language patterns (Language)
- All while being Revolutionary and creating Yanas (vehicles/paths)
