in a language, if the predicates are restricted to *only* these predicates:

the only predicates allowed are: is_a_part_of, is_a, instantiates, programs (has all of the requirements for its own origination in terms of the other predicates in a chain that has a flow which is necessitates labeling the entity because of an exact sequence map into existence, ie there is a relationship where subject bi-directionally instantiates object (there is a cycle composed of layers to prevent it from cycling because during the layering process a new capability emerges but that capability is for the observer to define the subject and the object)), reifies (if that definition from a triple with a programs predicate already exists and is turned into a formal ontology entry), manifests (this is how an instance instantiates its class if it comes first (bottom up)), embodies (has all of the parts inherited from its parent(s)), realizes (completes realizable transformation from a has_realizable property)

and the list of subjects and objects:[
<term>
bi-directional_instantiation_induced_emergence
[each of the allowed predicates]
[n order relationship] (these count the number of programs layers in the chain)
]
