Reality works because of relationships. This is not simply Buddhist interdependence but I will show you how it actually is. 

The word “is” actually necessitates “part”. Ie inheritance when there is nothing to inherit simply instantiates parts and vice versa. Therefore they are simultaneous, but they also cause the simultaneous emergence of “instantiates”. In the sense of platonic forms, the form of reality is the fact that instantiates arises ideally out of necessity for anything else. Therefore if anything exists, this is true and already happening. and because instantiates exists and “is” arises BECAUSE OF IT, this entire stack itself needs a label which also has a relationship to it so we say this stack is_a “programs” relationship. Then anything that exhibits this stack has a programs relationship to the label we put on it. These things that emerge from programmed stacks all interact and create a sort of… realityware
