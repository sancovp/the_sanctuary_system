What if we made an upper ontology where the fundamental classes are

- Entity
- Chain
- HigherChain(Chain)
- Relationship
  - Is a
  - Part of
  - Instantiates
  - Embodies: this is like instantiates except it refers to the property groups themselves. X doesn’t explicitly create Y so it isn’t instantiating it, rather Y embodies X. The key distinction is that instantiates is actually a programmatic thing that means the class produces the instance. If the new entry isn’t explicitly generable from the current class structure, the instantiates relationship cannot be used and the ontology of that class has to be built in order to convert the relationship phase from the phase1 chain:[embodies -> manifests -> reifies] to the phase2 chain:[is_a -> part_of -> instantiates -> programs] 
  - Manifests: this is when the embodies relationship is present. It means that because Y embodies X, Y is_a manifestation of X ie Y manifests X through observer recognition of the embodiment triple
  - Reifies: this is when the observer then ontologizes the manifestation using is a, part of, and instantiates, and all of the involved elements become ontology entries
  - Programs: already explained

Then can we actually get the entire pattern of ontology engineering to bootstrap? 

For example:

Is a necessitates part of and that necessitation is itself an instance necessitating instantiates. That is only possible because part of embodies is an and manifests instantiates. The subsequent classification of instantiates is a reifies. All of this embodies a chain and manifests chain which is reified as well. Chain is the base requirement for any property, which means an entity has a megachain of property chains that have attributes that are relationship chains. A top level chain which verifies an entity has a ‘programs’ relationship back to the entity in question, and if a chain programs an entity, the entity is a realizable within the ontology and therefore real. If the chain has UnnamedEntity in it, then it is partially hallucinatory. Then we add degrees of reality axiomatically.
