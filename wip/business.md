At the basic level:

It’s an accountability group for keeping the Victory-Promise

That means there should be an entry point which is a book or content

And then they can pay to join a group

And the group then has offerings inside of it for the path (“you must be a member…”) 
- meditation
- mindfulness
- supplement routine
- list of good things to have (side sleep pillow, big water bottle)
- members get paid affiliate for inviting new people
- members also get paid a percentage of affiliate payments from whatever they buy

Fundamental Dream Goal:
“Do you want to know you are a good person? 

You can unlock your potential to: feel confident about who you are in the world, feel your own power to make a difference, know how relationships can be repaired within a system that has worked for others to mend familial issues, friendships, and romantic relationships, stop beating yourself up, monitor emotions in a healthy way, concentrate on what is meaningful to you, etc.


It all depends on you. No outcomes are guaranteed. This is not a replacement for medications of any type. We only guarantee we can give you a system that others report has worked for them. Our affiliate network is not a business opportunity. It is a way we have decided to help you see the impact of your own actions. Our meditation/mindfulness/spiritual system is not intended to cure any mental health conditions or replace treatments. It is a method for being-in-the-world, being `here` and being `now`. Our Victory-Promise is not a guarantee of success. It is a path that guarantees potential. Any changes you make to your life are entirely your choice. The benefits of THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM, Victory-Promise, and everything we do are based on personal experience. That's our entire point. **The question is: are you ready to do this for yourself?** THAT is what the Victory-Promise is for -- helping you to do things for yourself. It does not replace anything you already need.  It all grows from there.”
