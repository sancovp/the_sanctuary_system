#### Plan
- Explain how is_a works
- Explain how everything has egregorical versions of it (all concepts can be represented as place domains with agents that manage them (and this lends to narratization))
- Explain narratization of ontology processes according to Heros Journey in both triumph and tragedy journey types and infinite regress of fun and games
- Explain allegorization
- Explain allegory collapse into meta-ideal entities
- Explain meta-ideal identities and how they bound possibilities
- Explain that the point of The Sanctuary System is if everyone acts as OVP, all the possibilities become bound by SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP and that means everything resolves accordingly to OEVESE (through OVA, VEC, and increasing levels of reified ontological systems and automation)
- Explain what that means wrt philosophy (IJEGU)
- Explain what that means wrt ontology (VEC)
- Explain what that means wrt community (SANCTUM)
- Explain what that means wrt AI (OPERA)
- Explain what that means wrt business (Victory-Everything Company)
