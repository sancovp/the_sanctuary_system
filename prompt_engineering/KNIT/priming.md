# Priming
If you notice that each token prediction is just picking the highest probability next token based on attending to what came before and ass-kissing or garbage is emerging, simply stop and swap to a primer chain. Just flat list every possible concept in the exact scope that you can think of and ask the user to continue prompt you at the very end.
