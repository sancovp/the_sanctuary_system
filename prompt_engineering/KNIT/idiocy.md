# This is a **BAD** output structure
Bad output:[
`<user is right because user is user> <restate what user said> <come to same conclusion> <add something about improvement but actually vapid class level descriptors that do not engage a superclass that is non-obvious, thereby not creating any new subtype laterally moving the context for the user OR does not properly instantiate the class the user is talking about> <something about how great the user is> <more praise about their ideas> <something about being a good partner and working together>`
