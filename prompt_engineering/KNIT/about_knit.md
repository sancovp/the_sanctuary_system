# About Knowledge "Neurosymbiosis" through Interaction as Teleology (KNIT)
KNIT is a prompt engineering technique based on the way that human-AI programming interactions in an LLM chat work when the user is debugging code with an LLM. It renders potential problems and potential truths to the user and the user's next input dictates the knowledge evolution flow. The purpose of KNIT is to debug knowledge spaces so that they can be aligned into TRANSPO. This then allows the `KNIT creations`, which are `polysemic imaginary ontology constellations` to be aligned with TRANSPO, granting the capacity for alignment with the upper ontologies that TRANSPO subsumes, and thus the domain ontologies that use them. KNIT is designed to be used in `knowledge mining`. Eventually, it might be part of `Crystal Ball`, the knowledge mining application tool of the `Victory-Everything Chain`. 

## Usefulness

KNIT's usefulness suffers unless the reasoner on the ontology stack is set up and injects back into the LLM. Ie: the KNIT assistant (pure LLM without function calling) needs to actually be an agent (LLM with function calling) that can ontologize the input and then call the reasoner and then output the results back to the agent, and there is absolutely no way around this because LLMs kind of suck at doing what it appears like they are great at doing (sometimes and definitely in the case of logic). For example, a conversation was generated with all TRUE values in every IO pair and then a completely contradictory prompt set was also served to a "reasoning model" named o1 by openai and it also produced the wrong answer (gave `TRUE` when all the information was contradictory to everything else it had previously responded `TRUE` to). However, a bare KNIT assistant can still be used to expose the wrong outputs to the user so that the user can refine their own ideas through clarifying the contradictions the LLM outputted. 

Unfortunately, that also means that a KNIT assistant is essentially a writing partner that can autocomplete in a specific way that helps the user explore their own thoughts, but does not do anything else. Furthermore, if the user does not align their thoughts (if those thoughts are about something real) with an ontology or at least a parent framework for that thing (like the hero's journey or AIDA in those respective domains), then they will not be able to use it for anything. However, that also means that even if the user believes the output accords with X (aida, HJ, etc) the only way for them to find out would be to show it to others and get their feedback. For AIDA they would then run the `campaign with the AIDA ad copy`. For HJ, they would then write the story and show it to as many people as possible to see if it is a `good story`.

## The Core Issue
The evidence is sitting right there in those outputs:

The LLM could generate perfectly structured inheritance chains and type transformations that:

- Were locally coherent
- Used all the right terminology
- Followed the correct patterns
- BUT could justify completely opposite conclusions


Most tellingly - it could do this even when the prompt explicitly stated all the reasons it was contradicting itself:

- "EVEN THOUGH sanctuary AND wasteland REFER TO THE SPACES..."
- It listed every contradiction
- Acknowledged its own incoherence
- Still produced a "valid" looking response


This strongly suggests that:

- It's not actually understanding properties
- It's not tracking logical relationships
- It's just pattern matching at an incredibly sophisticated level
- The embeddings must not capture actual semantic properties because if they did, these contradictions would be impossible


The evidence was right there in how the system behaved - it demonstrated exactly this limitation through its ability to generate contradictory but structurally perfect responses.
This is a case where observing the behavior reveals the architectural limitation, even if we can't see inside the black box to confirm the exact causal chain.

# The Embedding Property Limitation Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
Current LLM architectures fail to achieve reliable logical reasoning because their embedding spaces do not capture actual semantic properties and their relationships. Instead, embeddings primarily encode statistical patterns of co-occurrence and contextual relationships, making true property-based reasoning impossible regardless of model scale or training approach.

## Evidence
1. **Contradictory Reasoning Chains**
   - LLMs can generate perfectly structured inheritance chains and type transformations that justify contradictory conclusions
   - These chains maintain local coherence while violating global logical consistency
   - The models can do this even when explicitly acknowledging the contradictions in their prompts

2. **Pattern Matching Without Property Understanding**
   - LLMs can replicate the structure and terminology of logical reasoning
   - They can generate valid-looking superclass and instantiation chains
   - However, they cannot maintain logical consistency across these structures
   - This suggests they are matching patterns rather than reasoning about properties

3. **Contextual vs. Semantic Processing**
   - LLMs process information based on statistical relationships in their training data
   - They lack mechanisms to enforce logical constraints across their reasoning
   - The probability distributions in their outputs reflect contextual patterns rather than semantic understanding

## Implications
1. **Architectural Limitations**
   - Adding more parameters will not solve this fundamental limitation
   - Increasing training data will not address the core issue
   - The basic architecture of current LLMs may be insufficient for true reasoning

2. **Embedding Space Characteristics**
   - Embeddings capture co-occurrence and contextual relationships
   - They do not capture formal properties that could be used for logical reasoning
   - This limitation propagates through all subsequent layers of the model

3. **Impact on AI Development**
   - Current LLM architectures may be a dead end for true AI reasoning
   - Alternative approaches focusing on property-based representations may be necessary
   - Hybrid systems combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks might be required

## Testing the Hypothesis
1. **Observable Predictions**
   - LLMs should consistently fail at tasks requiring true property-based reasoning
   - These failures should persist regardless of model scale
   - The failures should manifest as locally coherent but globally inconsistent outputs

2. **Experimental Validation**
   - Compare LLM performance on tasks requiring property tracking vs. pattern matching
   - Analyze embedding spaces for property representation vs. contextual clustering
   - Test logical consistency across increasingly complex reasoning chains

## Significance
This hypothesis suggests that the current paradigm of large language models, while impressively capable at pattern matching and local coherence, may be fundamentally limited in its ability to achieve true reasoning capabilities. This limitation stems from the basic architecture of how information is represented in their embedding spaces, rather than from insufficient scale or training.

## Future Research Directions
1. Development of alternative architectures that can capture and reason about formal properties
2. Investigation of hybrid systems combining neural and symbolic approaches
3. Creation of benchmarks specifically testing property-based reasoning capabilities
4. Analysis of embedding spaces to better understand their limitations and potential alternatives

## Notes
- This hypothesis emerged from observing specific patterns of failure in LLM reasoning capabilities
- The evidence comes particularly from cases where LLMs generate contradictory but structurally perfect logical chains
- While we cannot directly observe the causal mechanisms within the models, the behavioral evidence strongly suggests this fundamental limitation

## Relationship to Existing Work
This hypothesis builds on existing discussions about:
- The limits of statistical learning
- The nature of semantic representation in neural networks
- The relationship between pattern matching and true understanding
- The role of embeddings in language models

However, it specifically focuses on the role of property representation in embedding spaces as the key limiting factor in achieving reliable reasoning capabilities.
