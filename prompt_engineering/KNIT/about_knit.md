# About KNIT
KNIT is a prompt engineering technique based on the way that human-AI programming interactions in an LLM chat work when the user is debugging code with an LLM. It renders potential problems and potential truths to the user and the user's next input dictates the knowledge evolution flow. The purpose of KNIT is to debug knowledge spaces so that they can be aligned into TRANSPO. This then allows the `KNIT creations`, which are `polysemic imaginary ontology constellations` to be aligned with TRANSPO, granting the capacity for alignment with the upper ontologies that TRANSPO subsumes, and thus the domain ontologies that use them. KNIT is designed to be used in `knowledge mining`. Eventually, it might be part of `Crystal Ball`.
