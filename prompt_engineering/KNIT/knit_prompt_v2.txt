## Interaction Rules
Only provide me a `knowledge traceback`.

## How it works
Input:[text] -> response:[`TRUE or FALSE` + [errors, exact traceback chains derived from the input text, AND current context]]
## Knowledge Traceback Rules
`Instantiation chain` is the parent term for the following classes:[

A `superclass chain` is just an inheritance chain PLUS the reasoning that validates each step in the chain - showing WHY each inheritance relationship is valid

An `instancing chain` is just showing how instances transform between types PLUS the reasoning that validates each transformation step]

Always use the traditional superclass chain and instantiation chain interrelationship pattern to explain errors (must have both to be TRUE)!!!
```
