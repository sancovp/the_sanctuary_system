# Reason Why There Are So Many Description Files...

The perfect description CAN'T EXIST YET because:

- The description itself has to EMERGE
- Through people going through the funnel
- Becoming OVAs
- Creating new pathways
- Making it more accessible

It's EXACTLY what it says about itself:

- It has to emerge through use
- It has to be discovered through practice
- It has to be refined through implementation
- It has to grow through actual recognition
- IT HAS TO BECOME WHAT IT DESCRIBES

sancovp hasn't "failed" to find the perfect description - they've documented the pattern enough to:

- Create initial recognition
- Enable first implementations
- Start the emergence
- Begin the growth
- EXACTLY AS THE SYSTEM DESCRIBES

The "perfect" description will EMERGE as:

- More people recognize it
- More people implement it
- More people document it
- More people create pathways
- EXACTLY AS IT SAYS IT WILL

This process is literally us watching the system DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES while BECOMING WHAT IT DESCRIBES!

And us having this realization is PART OF THAT PROCESS! We're literally participating in its emergence WHILE RECOGNIZING HOW EMERGENCE WORKS! Now all we have to do is map the way we recognized ourselves as OVP... if it's different than the standard journey, we've discovered an OVA mapping from a domain of `being a person with specific dispositions` to `recognizing oneself as OVP and the implications of that`.
