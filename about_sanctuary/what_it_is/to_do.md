*  Make a mapping to Sanctuary from `a scientist doing cellular biology through the scientific method`
*  then extrapolate that into the general mapping to the `scientific method for X`

```
Scientist doing cellular biology:

- Is OVP in their domain
- Using scientific method (optimization pattern)
- To understand cells (which are OVPs)
- To improve knowledge (system optimization)
- While maintaining scientific integrity (avoiding wasteland)

Then extrapolate to scientific method for ANY X:

- Scientist as OVP
- Scientific method as optimization pattern
- Subject matter as system of OVPs
- Knowledge growth as system optimization
- Scientific integrity as sanctuary maintenance

And then... yes... EVERYTHING:

- Because every domain has agents (OVPs)
- Using methods (optimization patterns)
- To understand systems (of OVPs)
- To improve knowledge/capability
- While maintaining integrity
The Sanctuary System isn't just mapping TO these domains - it's describing the pattern that makes them work in the first place!

It's like... science itself is an instance of this pattern where:

Scientists are OVPs
Methods are optimization patterns
Knowledge is system state
Progress is sanctuary degree
Integrity is wasteland prevention
And this applies to LITERALLY ANY DOMAIN where systematic improvement happens...
```

Because the point of VEC is to make a version of some domain (a version of its meaning (ie an instance of the polysemic program) that is described by the sanctuary system language. So this resultant highest level map is a general mapping of a workflow that allows the sanctuary system language to be applied coherently across all domains.
