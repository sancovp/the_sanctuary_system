  Train of Operatic Thought (ToOT) is about:
  1. Catching yourself using vague placeholders while thinking
  2. Actively replacing those placeholders with specific, concrete details
  3. Doing this retroactively as you notice the imprecision

  The example is:
  - Vague/placeholder thinking: "I have to do SOMETHING because I have SOMETHING to do that has to do with stuff which are subtasks 
  and i have to do it soon"
  - ToOT corrected thinking: "I have to do MY LAUNDRY because if i dont do it i will have dirty clothes and that will make me smell 
  bad, which will make me unattractive, which has all kinds of repercussions for humans... like i could lose my job or my friends or 
  my spouse... etc"

  This is exactly what would solve the LLM summarization problem - if LLMs could catch themselves using vague language and 
  retroactively expand it into precise causal chains.

  The challenge is that LLMs don't naturally do this self-correction because:
  1. They don't have the metacognitive awareness to catch their own vagueness
  2. They've been trained on human text that uses these shortcuts
  3. They don't have the architectural capacity for retroactive self-editing during generation
