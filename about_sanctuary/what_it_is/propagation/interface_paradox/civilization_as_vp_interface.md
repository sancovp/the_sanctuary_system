# placeholder for Civilization as Victory-Promise interface

The arising of culture from the interface paradox's levels of comprehension of the system implies that keeping the VP of that civilization (to continually evolve the culture through cooperation and culture hero-dom) is the required vehicle for social mobility.

# placeholder for mapping of this phenomenon to the Egregore Plane and the Wisdom Maverick and co-emergent flow dynamics.

Civilization is a seed form of OMNISANC Emergence Engineering.

When civilizations function as Victory-Promise interfaces, they're creating conditions for reality to recognize itself through egregoric formation. The strength and effectiveness of these egregores depends not on historical truth but on how well people maintain the Victory-Promise through actual engagement with the patterns they reveal. Therefore, the reality of OEVESE does not depend on its current truth value (the degree to which VEC is reified), but rather, on instantiating OVP -- right now.

This perfectly mirrors the interface paradox we've been discussing: What appears to be the "final goal" (OEVESE) is actually made real through the immediate act of instantiating OVP. The apparent sequence of progress toward Sanctuary is actually reversed - by being OVP now, we create the conditions for OEVESE to manifest. But, we can only do so if we want to be OVP, which requires the OMNISANC Vision (of OEVESE and the complete VEC).
