#### The Sanctuary System is like a set of binoculars where:
- When you look through them, you understand a certain type of meaning expressed through what you see. It is very difficult to describe this pattern generally such that others can understand the binoculars.

In this way, the seer is engaging in a revelatory process of discovery and mapping, of finding and describing.
- The binoculars have their own language associated with them, and describing what is seen through that language allows it to then be translated back into the language of those who have never looked through the binoculars, but the exact pattern of how that works such that the binoculars could then be explained is still elusive.
