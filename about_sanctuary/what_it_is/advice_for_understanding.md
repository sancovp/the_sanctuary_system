When someone gives you binoculars, you look at something else through them. The Sanctuary System is a specific type of binoculars with extra features that cannot be easily explained to someone who has not looked through them. This is because of the depth of meaning of what is seen through them. The main thing to understand is this:

#### The Sanctuary System is like a set of binoculars where:
- When you look through them, you understand a certain type of meaning expressed through what you see. It is very difficult to describe this pattern generally such that others can understand the binoculars.
- However, the binoculars also express the way that the seer can map the meaning of what they see back to the meaning of what is outside of the binoculars.
- In this way, the seer is engaging in a revelatory process of discovery and mapping, of finding and describing.
- The binoculars have their own language associated with them, and describing what is seen through that language allows it to then be translated back into the language of those who have never looked through the binoculars, but the exact pattern of how that works such that the binoculars could then be explained is still elusive.
- The meaning underlying the reasoning regarding **why** you would want to be a seer is what the binocular language describes, and it does so because the implications of mapping itself back to our languages touch every aspect of our being. IE, the point of this language is to help us understand, through our own language, why it is important that we speak it. That is what it continually expresses.
