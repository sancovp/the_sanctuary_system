# Orientations Toward Knowledge Markets: PIO vs VEC

## PIO-Orientiation
In a PIO-oriented market, experts write systems that are not connected to ontologies, so nobody can map out what they are really saying. This is because what they generally are doing is finding concepts that already exist in theory and giving them metaphorical names, because they don't understand the theory that already exists for the domain or how it would be described by other domains. They then market them and people with less expertise than them fall into their funnel. They then consider that person a master, and if that funnel delivers any positive effects, they are attributed to that master. This creates a feedback loop that takes advantage of society in the form of driving conformity towards the pathway presented. This makes that person famous even if their success rate is extremely low, and the people who are successful at using their funnel had to do their own work.

The reason this works is because the metaphors function in the cognition of the observer as allegories whereby the observer can go on a journey to find the mapping between the metaphor and the instance that somehow embodies the properties of the metaphorical thing. For example, giving people the hero's journey framework to write a story. This enables people to write stories in general but it doesn't enable them to write a *good* story. Writing a good story as a process would require an ontology with dependencies for the workflow. Nonetheless, they can write a story and if other people think it is good, they then believe themselves to have learned how to use the hero's journey. They then have completed the allegorical journey embedded in the metaphorical system by reifying it in real life! In fact, in the field of writing, the hero's journey is used by so-called experts in exactly that way in order to make sales. Some of the teachers themselves do not even have a good story under their belt -- just good marketing and social proof. 


Fundamentally, this type of `metaphor -> journey -> allegory <-> real thing` sequence (called PIO transference) is what PIO denotes -- Polysemic Imaginary Ontology. Why? Because it is through polysemy that the imagination can construct an ontologically valid instance of something, not by process of what the metaphorical framework says. A metaphorical framework that can induce PIO-transference is a PIO-constellation (group of metaphorical terms that embed allegories that resolve as real instances if traversed correctly, although the traversal is indeterminate because this ontology is implicit and usually requires distant-yet-resonant domain alignment (on account of the metaphors, which are not ontological claims, themselves)).

#### Signs of a PIO-constellation
- Has no alignment to an upper ontology
- Has structured entity templates or workflow templates but not both
- For example in creative writing, there might be a workflow template like:
  ```
  build your character
  # but then it just has fields like "describe their flaw" and it doesnt have a template for describing a flaw.
  ```
## VEC-Orientation
In a VEC-oriented market, experts write systems that are connected to ontologies. As a result, all knowledge and expertise pathways are interoperable and mapped out so that everyone in general knows how to achieve what others have already achieved. Furthermore, it ensures that all social proof is *justified*.

#### Key Differences Between VEC and PIO systems
- A VEC system is a domain ontology (entity templates) and a workflow ontology or process map (like OMG basically but also tied to the upper ontology, so not exactly like OMG), together, AND they need to be tied to an upper ontology (even if it is the most simple one imaginable (entity, partof, isa)). This creates a closed system for describing concepts and their applications (ie capacities for instantiation through an assembly process). This alignment exists either explicitly or implicitly. When implicit, the system is a lower Sanctuary Degree (but still higher than any PIO-constellation for the same thing). 
  - A PIO system has either entity templates or workflow templates.
  - A PIO system has no upper ontology.
 
## Example of a More VEC-oriented Approach
The Human Genome Project (HGP) is an excellent example of a VEC-oriented scientific paradigm. It embodies many of the principles of a VEC system because it was designed to create a comprehensive, interoperable, and scalable framework for knowledge and application. Let’s break down how the HGP aligns with the VEC concept and how it contrasts with traditional scientific paradigms.

How the Human Genome Project Aligns with VEC

Integration of Domain and Workflow Ontologies:

Domain Ontology:
- The HGP explicitly defined and standardized genomic elements (e.g., genes, regulatory regions, base pairs) and their relationships.
- The knowledge was organized into a structured framework that was universally understood and could be applied across biology, medicine, and biotechnology.

Workflow Ontology:
- The HGP established standardized methods and processes for sequencing, annotating, and analyzing the genome, making workflows replicable and scalable.
- These workflows were carefully documented, allowing other researchers to build upon them.

Upper Ontology as a Foundational Framework:

- The HGP operated with an implicit upper ontology: the fundamental relationships of entities like "gene," "sequence," "function," and their is-a, part-of, and interacts-with hierarchies.
- This provided coherence and ensured that the data could be interoperable with other systems, such as protein databases, disease models, and computational biology tools.

Interoperability and Scalability:

- By standardizing data formats, workflows, and definitions, the HGP ensured that its results could integrate seamlessly into various scientific and industrial applications, from pharmaceuticals to agriculture.
- It also allowed for rapid scaling as new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, emerged.

Making Expertise Accessible:

- The HGP made genomic knowledge and tools accessible to a global community, enabling researchers without deep genomic expertise to leverage the data for their work.
- This democratization of knowledge is a hallmark of a VEC system.

Cross-Domain Integration:

- The HGP wasn’t confined to genomics; it was inherently interdisciplinary. It connected fields like molecular biology, bioinformatics, medicine, and even computer science, creating a shared framework that all these disciplines could use.
- How HGP Differs from Traditional Scientific Paradigms

Traditional Scientific Paradigm:
Siloed Knowledge:
- Research often occurs within isolated domains, and the results are not immediately interoperable with other disciplines.
```Example: Geneticists might sequence a genome, but the data might not integrate with biochemical studies of protein function without significant reformatting.```
Ad Hoc Workflows:
- Methods are often bespoke and vary between labs, making it difficult to reproduce or scale.
Fragmentation:
- Knowledge isn’t always organized into a universal structure. Ontologies are implicit, if they exist at all.
Human Genome Project as a VEC Paradigm:
Unified Ontology:
- The HGP explicitly mapped genes and their relationships, providing a domain ontology that became a standard across disciplines.
Standardized Workflows:
- Sequencing, annotation, and analysis were carried out using defined workflows, ensuring consistency and scalability.
Interdisciplinary and Accessible:
- The project created systems that could integrate data from multiple fields and made those systems accessible to researchers globally.

VEC as a New Scientific Paradigm
The HGP shows what a VEC-oriented scientific paradigm looks like:

Systematization:
- Knowledge and workflows are systematically mapped, ensuring they are explicit and reusable.
Interoperability:
- The system allows for seamless integration across disciplines, removing silos and fostering collaboration.
Scalability:
- The system can grow and evolve with new technologies and discoveries while maintaining consistency.
Transparency and Accessibility:
- The system democratizes knowledge, making it usable by non-experts without sacrificing rigor.
- This contrasts with the traditional scientific paradigm, which often prioritizes domain-specific innovation over systematized, cross-domain integration.

Implications for the Future of Science
If the scientific community adopts more VEC-oriented principles, we could see:

- Standardized Knowledge Systems: Interdisciplinary research could flourish as fields adopt shared ontologies and workflows.
- Global Collaboration: Like the HGP, projects could become inherently collaborative and accessible to the global community.
- Scalable Solutions: Knowledge systems would be designed to adapt to new technologies and discoveries without breaking their foundational structure.

# VEC as Ontology-Oriented Knowledge Management through Collapsing PIO Systems

**VEC (Verified Explicit Connection)** represents an advanced form of ontology-oriented knowledge management that transforms **PIO (Polysemic Imaginary Ontology)** systems into VEC systems by **collapsing metaphorical frameworks into explicit, realizable ontologies.** 

## **How the Collapse Happens**
- **Metaphors in PIO Systems**:
  - PIO systems rely on metaphorical frameworks that guide users through implicit and indeterminate processes. These frameworks use loosely defined entities and workflows, leaving users to interpret and instantiate them subjectively.
  - Example: A creative writing framework might instruct, "Describe your character's flaw," without providing an explicit template for what a "flaw" is or how it integrates with other story elements.

- **Collapsing Metaphors**:
  - In a VEC transformation, the metaphor ceases to function as a subjective, interpretive tool because it becomes **directly ontologically realizable**. The entities, relationships, and processes previously implied by the metaphor are explicitly defined and mapped.
  - Example: Instead of metaphorically describing a "flaw," a VEC system would define it ontologically (e.g., "A flaw is a cognitive, moral, or situational trait that creates tension in the plot") and provide workflows for its creation, refinement, and integration.

- **From PIO to VEC**:
  - The collapse occurs when:
    1. **Entity Templates**: Implicit concepts are transformed into explicit, structured ontologies (e.g., "character flaw" becomes a defined entity with attributes and relationships).
    2. **Workflow Templates**: Vague instructions become detailed process maps tied to the ontology (e.g., a step-by-step guide for creating and refining the flaw within a story structure).
    3. **Upper Ontology**: The entities and workflows are tied to a universal framework (e.g., "entity," "is-a," "part-of"), ensuring scalability and interoperability.

## **Why the Collapse is Crucial**
- **Eliminates Ambiguity**: By collapsing metaphors, the system becomes actionable and repeatable, eliminating reliance on user interpretation.
- **Ontological Realizability**: The system no longer functions as a symbolic guide but as a directly applicable framework with concrete outputs.
- **Scalability and Interoperability**: The integration of domain and workflow ontologies under an upper ontology ensures that knowledge can scale across contexts and disciplines.

## **Example: Creative Writing**
### PIO System:
- Workflow: "Build your character."
- Entity Template: "Describe their flaw."
- Gap: Users must interpret "flaw" metaphorically and figure out how to create and integrate it themselves.

### VEC System:
- Domain Ontology: "Flaw" is defined as a trait with specific attributes (e.g., internal conflict, external consequences) and relationships (e.g., tied to theme, antagonist).
- Workflow Ontology: A detailed process for identifying, developing, and integrating the flaw into the plot.
- Upper Ontology: The system ties "character," "flaw," and "plot" to universal concepts like "entity," "part-of," and "dependency."

By collapsing the metaphor of "flaw," the VEC system transforms a PIO framework into an explicit, actionable, and ontologically realizable system.

## **Conclusion**
VEC is the process of systematically collapsing PIO systems by transforming their metaphorical frameworks into explicit ontological structures and workflows. This collapse ensures that previously ambiguous or interpretive systems become actionable, scalable, and directly realizable, making them universally applicable across knowledge domains.
