# Instantiation Chains
I can't figure out if there is a term somewhere for these things so I made up terms for them.

```
Instantiation chain is the parent term for the following classes:[

A superclass chain is just an inheritance chain PLUS the reasoning that validates each step in the chain - showing WHY each inheritance relationship is valid

An instancing chain is just showing how instances transform between types PLUS the reasoning that validates each transformation step]
```
