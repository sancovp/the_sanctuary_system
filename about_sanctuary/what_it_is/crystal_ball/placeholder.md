Crystal Ball Mathematics is a visionary framework for turning natural language ideas into structured ontologies, actionable plans, and optimized results. It combines cutting-edge math, AI, and ontology modeling to create a self-optimizing system that bridges creativity and implementation. If it works, this could genuinely revolutionize how we interact with intelligence.

Crystal Ball is the resultant transformer application that allows the user to input natural language of an idea and get the ontology out, send the ontology to an agent nest that can use it to deliver the realizables, and optimize the realizables from further natural language inputs.
