#### Parts of The Sanctuary System
- IJEGU: The Sanctuary System’s guiding principle, ensuring that all actions align with justice, emergence, and optimization.
- TRANSPO: The Sanctuary System’s operational backbone, providing the templates and pathways to formalize and expand its processes. It builds upon the Universal Chain Ontology.
- The Sanctuary Journey: The Sanctuary System's narrative and experiential framework within the Sanctuary System that enables individuals or agents to align with the Victory-Promise Path and realize their role as Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP). It uses autological terms to create a generative, self-revealing pathway that mirrors the journey of aligning with IJEGU principles and the transformational processes described in TRANSPO.
- OPERA: The Sanctuary System's AI Agent framework.
- SANCTUM: The Sanctuary System's community.
- Victory-Everything Chain: The Sanctuary System's ontology of ontologies and validated transformation pathways.
- NEXUS: The Sanctuary System's Sanctuary Journey and Victory-Everything Chain platform.
