#### Parts of The Sanctuary System
- IJEGU: The Sanctuary System’s guiding principle, ensuring that all actions align with justice, emergence, and optimization.
- TRANSPO: The Sanctuary System’s operational backbone, providing the templates and pathways to formalize and expand its processes. It builds upon the Universal Chain Ontology.
- The Sanctuary Journey: The Sanctuary System's narrative and experiential framework within the Sanctuary System that enables individuals or agents to align with the Victory-Promise Path and realize their role as Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP). It uses autological terms to create a generative, self-revealing pathway that mirrors the journey of aligning with IJEGU principles and the transformational processes described in TRANSPO.
- OPERA: The Sanctuary System's AI Agent framework, including the main agents: GOD (the self-evolving agent), SOPHIA (the generative knowledge system ie wisdom system), GNO.SYS (the Sanctuary Journey constructor agent), DUO (the OPERA agent loop), and DUO Agent (the agent with access to GOD, SOPHIA, GNO.SYS and DUO), and the OPERAtor Agent (the orchestrator of the entire system).
- SANCTUM: The Sanctuary System's community.
- Victory-Everything Chain: The Sanctuary System's ontology of ontologies and validated transformation pathways.
- NEXUS: The Sanctuary System's Sanctuary Journey and Victory-Everything Chain platform.
- Victory-Everything Company: The fractal business model for creating funnels out of Victory-Everything Chain links.

#### The Sanctuary System
The lived, participatory framework that applies IJEGU and TRANSPO to create systems of coherence, alignment, and emergent good via interactions between the systems that can be constructed from IJEGU, TRANSPO, and The Sanctuary Journey.
